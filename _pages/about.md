# About Me
I am a mathematical engineer from Universidad de Chile who took part in a 2 year Double De-
gree Program at CentraleSupélec (France). I have recently finished a Master’s Degree in Ap-
plied Mathematics, and seek to pursue a PhD in topics related to Machine Learning Theory.
My academic achievements, spanning fascinating applied projects as well as a robust maths
curriculum; testify for my hard work, motivation and attention to detail.

I’m passionate about maths and their real world applications; I’m particularly keen on Proba-
bility & Statistics, and their use to build the theory and algorithmics of ML. My dream is to
use these tools to attack the big challenges of today’s world: Climate Change, Sustainability,
Circular Economy, Industry 4.0, Social Equality, among many others.
