As part of the Parcours Recherche program, I participated in the "Fête de la Science 2021" together with a team consisting of Jean-Baptiste Dubois, Clément Mosser, Pedro Sotomayor and myself. We presented a tutorial to the 4th grade students from Collège Roland Garros on the topic of "Mathematics for Decision-Making" ("Les maths et la prise de décision"), and included a didactic game to illustrate the phenomenon of strategic voting. We also showed a video in which some of the key concepts were explained; the video can be found [here](https://le-village-des-sciences-paris-saclay.fr/des-apprentis-chercheurs-racontent-lintelligence-artificielle-les-maths-et-la-prise-de-decision/) (it's in French).
