I presented the contents of our accepted Neurips paper on the Probability Seminar from the FCFM at Universidad de Chile. It was a ~50 minute talk in which I outlined all the different elements and the main results from the paper. The slides are available [here](http://xavimaass.github.io/files/slides_proba_seminar.pdf), and the full presentation is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=DgU_Cvy2BAY9FwK0&v=3TOks5Uz6FM&feature=youtu.be.
