I presented my work on a Hotelling-Downs Game for elections with binary issues at the XVIII Summer School on Discrete Mathematics organized by the Center for Mathematical Modelling (CMM) at the ISCV in Valparaíso, Chile. The details of the program are given in the following [link](https://eventos.cmm.uchile.cl/discretas2023/programa/).
