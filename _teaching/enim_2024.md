Together with my fellow TA Diego Olgu√≠n, we taught a short course for the National Mathematical Engineering Encounter (ENIM 2024). It covered key theoretical and mathematical results related to neural networks; essential concepts such as network architectures, the universal approximation theorem, and optimization through stochastic gradient descent. Theoretical discussions were also combined with practical tutorials, focusing on applying the concepts on real-world data, with convolutional neural networks for image classification and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for simulating ODEs. The official course page is [here](https://eventos.cmm.uchile.cl/enim2024/redes/), and the official GitHub repository shall be found [here](https://github.com/diegoolguinw/Math_Behind_Magic?externo=1).
