Together with my fellow TA Diego Olgu√≠n, we taught a short course exploring key theoretical and mathematical results related to neural networks, and linking them to real-world applications. It covered essential concepts such as network architectures, the universal approximation theorem, and optimization through stochastic gradient descent. Theoretical discussions were also combined with practical tutorials, focusing on applying convolutional neural networks for image classification and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for simulating physical systems. A reference to the course shall be found [here](https://eventos.cmm.uchile.cl/enim2024/redes/), and the official GitHub repository shall be found [here](https://github.com/diegoolguinw/Math_Behind_Magic?externo=1).
